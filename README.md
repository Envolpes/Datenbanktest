# Sportfest-Tracker

This was a project which was assigned during computer science.
The task was to program an Android application which had different pages connected with an SQL-backend.
Furthermore data retrieval as well as manipulation had to be implemented.

## What I have learned

I have learned to build a java application for Android from scratch as well as designing, creating and using a Maria-DB SQL-backend.
