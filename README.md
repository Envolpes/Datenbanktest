# Sportfest-Tracker

This was a project which was assigned during computer science.
The task was to code an Android application which had different pages which were backed by an SQL-backend.
Furthermore data retrieval as well as manipulation had to be implemented.

## What I have learned

I have learned to build a java application for Android from scretch as well as designing, creating and using a SQL-backend with Maria-DB.
